          <p>The Ryzen 9 7940HS is a powerful Phoenix family APU that saw the light of day in H1 2023. Its 8 cores are powered by the Zen 4 architecture and are SMT-enabled for a total of 16 processing threads. 4.0 GHz is the base clock speed and the highest Boost clock speed achievable is 5.2 GHz. The 7940HS introduces Ryzen AI which is AMD's answer to Intel's DL Boost and GNA technologies. The Radeon 780M serves as the integrated graphics adapter.</p>
          <p>The 7940HS is built with TSMC's 4 nm process for high, as of late 2023, energy efficiency.</p>
          <code>AMD is for work processes better then Intel</code>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Architecture & Features</strong>
            <br>
            Phoenix family chips are powered by the Zen 4 architecture, much like Dragon Range family chips are. The latter however lacks hardware AI workload acceleration capabilities that Phoenix has. Ryzen AI is set to give applications such as DaVinci Resolve and Photoshop quite a bit of generative AI magic.<br>
            More importantly, Zen 4 introduces AVX512 support (which Zen 3 chips did not have) and, thanks to a plethora of other improvements including larger caches/registers/buffers across the board, is slated to bring a double-digit IPC improvement.<br>
            The 7940HS has 16 MB of L3 cache and support for super-fast RAM (up to LPDDR5x-7500 or DDR5-5600, including ECC-enabled memory). The processor is compatible with USB 4 and thus with Thunderbolt; PCIe support is limited to the 4.0 spec for a throughput of 1.97 GB/s per lane.<br>
            OS support is limited to 64-bit editions of Windows 11 and Windows 10 and of course to Linux. Note that the chip isn't overclockable and neither is it user-replaceable as it gets soldered down for good (FP7, FP7r2, FP8 socket interfaces).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance</strong>
            <br>
            The average 7940HS in our database is in the same league as the Core i9-12900HK and also, somewhat disappointingly, the Ryzen 7 7840HS, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned.<br>
            Thanks to its decent cooling solution and a long-term CPU power limit of 80 W, the ROG Zephyrus G14 GA402XY is among the fastest laptops built around the 7940HS that we know of. It can be about 15% faster in CPU-bound workloads than the slowest system featuring the same chip in our database, as of August 2023.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Graphics</strong>
            <br>
            The Radeon 780M has 12 CUs (768 shaders) running at up to 2,800 MHz. This is a very fast iGPU, as of late 2023. It will let you use up to 4 monitors with resolutions as high as SUHD 4320p, and it is also capable of HW-encoding and HW-decoding most video codecs including AVC, HEVC and AV1, but more importantly it is fast enough for proper 1080p gaming as long as one is fine with low to medium detail settings.<br>
            Your mileage may vary depending on how high the CPU power limits are, how competent the cooling solution of the system is, how fast the RAM of the system is (there is no dedicated VRAM).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Power consumption</strong>
            <br>
            This Ryzen 9 series chip has a long-term power limit (default TDP) of 35 W to 54 W, giving laptop makers a choice between longer battery life and higher performance. Either way, an active cooling solution is a must for a system powered by this chip.

            The RTX 2000 Mobile Ada Generation is a professional mobile graphics chip by NVIDIA, launched on March 21st, 2023. Built on the 5 nm process, and based on the AD107 graphics processor, the chip supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. The AD107 graphics processor is an average sized chip with a die area of 159 mm² and 18,900 million transistors. It features 3072 shading units, 96 texture mapping units, and 48 ROPs. Also included are 96 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 24 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 8 GB GDDR6 memory with the RTX 2000 Mobile Ada Generation, which are connected using a 128-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1635 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2115 MHz, memory is running at 2000 MHz (16 Gbps effective).
            </p>
            <p>
            Its power draw is rated at 50 W maximum. This device has no display connectivity, as it is not designed to have monitors connected to it. Rather it is intended for use in laptop/notebooks and will use the output of the host mobile device. RTX 2000 Mobile Ada Generation is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface.
